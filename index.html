            Although the penguin is the icon of the Antarctic, many penguins
            prefer lower latitudes. Several species venture as far south as the
            Antarctic Peninsula, but only the emperors and the Adélies live
            along the continental coastline.
          </p>

          <h2>Adélies</h2>
          <figure style="float: left">

            />
            <figcaption>A typical Adélie nest.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            If you were to conjure up an image of a penguin, it would probably
            look quite a lot like an Adélie: With a black back and white front,
            it’s the archetypical tuxedo-clad penguin. Named for Adéle, the wife
            of French explorer Admiral Durmont d’Urville, the Adélie is also one
            of the best-studied penguins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adélies spend most of the year at sea, but in October, when spring
            comes to Antarctica, they head for dry land on which to build nests,
            mate, lay eggs, and raise their chicks. An Adélie nest is lined with
            small stones. Prize pebbles are squabbled over and often purloined
            from inattentive neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early November, the female lays two eggs and returns to the sea
            to feed, leaving the male to be the eggs’ first caretaker. The
            parents take turns incubating the eggs though, which hatch in about
            35 days, and they continue to alternate between gathering food and
            watching over the young chicks.
          </p>
          <figure style="float: right">
            <img
              src="assets/kd_begging_chick_sm.jpg"

            <figcaption>A young Adélie with a full stomach.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Finally, the growing chicks, too hungry to be provisioned by just
            one parent at a time, are left together in a tightly packed group
            called a crèche, while both parents go hunting. In February, the
            juveniles exchange their down coats for seaworthy adult feathers
            and, along with the adults, soon leave the breeding ground for the
            pack ice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adélies breed in a number of places along the Antarctic coast, from
            the Ross Sea in the south to the Antarctic Peninsula far to the
            north. The southernmost quartet of colonies—at Cape Crozier, Cape
            Bird, and Cape Royds on Ross Island and another on Beaufort
            Island—differ from each other in size, weather, and distance from
            the open sea. Cape Crozier, known as Penguin City, is by far the
            largest, with about 150,000 breeding pairs. The trip from Penguin
            City to the ocean is a short one, but the large number of birds
            means that competition for food is intense. Life is more of a picnic
            for the penguins in the smaller colonies, even if they must walk a
            bit farther to reach the food.
          </p>

              meltwater.

          </figure>
          <p>
            In general, though, all the Ross Sea Adélies are doing well. Climate
            change has brought stronger winds that keep the water near the shore
            almost free of ice, making feeding areas more accessible. A warmer
            climate is benefiting these penguins—for the moment. But if
            temperatures continue to climb, these birds will face the severe
            problems being experienced by the Adélie in the Antarctic Peninsula
            region.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the many months that the Adélies are away from land, they’re
            dependent on sea ice. It’s where they hunt and otherwise live. If
            their winter habitat is diminished, so are the penguins. This is
            currently the plight of the Adélies near the western Antarctic
            Peninsula—the region of Antarctica that’s experienced the greatest
            warming and greatest loss of sea ice. In addition, commercial
            fisheries and growing numbers of whales are increasingly competing
            for the reduced numbers of krill, a staple of the Adélie diet. This
            penguin population has declined by 80 percent since the 1970s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other climate changes will probably affect the breeding success of
            the Adélies. Antarctica is the driest place on earth—but with higher
            temperatures comes more precipitation and more meltwater from
            current snowfall and ancient glaciers. The pebbles that line an
            Adélie nest will protect the eggs from a small amount of meltwater,
            but a significant amount of meltwater will wash them away. And a
            serious snowstorm can not only destroy the eggs but can bury a stoic
            parent who tries to shelter them.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to biologist David Ainley, who’s been studying Adélie
            penguins in Antarctica for more than twenty-five years, “If global
            warming begins to influence the more southern reaches of the
            Antarctic continent, then the entire world’s population of Adélie
            penguins could be at risk.”
          </p>

          <h2>Emperors</h2>
          <figure style="float: right">
            <img
              src="assets/emperorhead_glenn_grant.jpg"
              alt="An Emperor penguin looking downwards"
            />
            <figcaption>Emperor penguin.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The story of the emperors is one of superlatives: They are the
            tallest penguins, and the heaviest. They can dive the deepest. And
            they breed and raise their chicks in the harshest environmental
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike any other penguin, emperors raise their young during the
            Antarctic winter. Undaunted by fierce winds and plummeting
            temperatures, the mature emperors heave themselves out of the sea in
            March and head for their breeding grounds. The trek may be a long
            one: In the film March of the Penguins, the emperors walk about 70
            miles (113 km), but for some other colonies, the distance is
            considerably less. Most colonies—there maybe 25 to 30—breed on fast
            ice along the coast, although two known colonies breed on land.
          </p>
          <figure style="float: right">
            <img
              src="assets/emperor_kiss.jpg"
              alt="Two emperor penguins standing in front of each other with touching beaks"
            />
            <figcaption>Emperor penguins courting.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Courtships happen in a hurry, and in May or early June each female
            lays a single egg that must be carefully transferred to the feet of
            her mate. The male covers the egg with a flap of skin from its
            abdomen called a brood pouch and incubates the egg for two months.
            To keep warm during this dark, cold time, the papa penguins huddle
            closely together, taking turns being on the outside and inside of
            the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the eggs are safely in the care of the males, the females
            immediately return to the sea to hunt. If all goes well, they’ll be
            back in time to feed their newly hatched chicks. Then, like Adélie
            parents, the adults alternate making trips to the sea to satisfy the
            voracious appetites of their fast-growing youngsters. Eventually,
            when the chicks are large enough to take care of themselves, the
            parents begin to forage at the same time. In December or January,
            all the birds make their way to the sea—a shorter distance now that,
            with warmer temperatures, some of the fast ice has broken out.
          </p>
          <figure style="float: left">

            <figcaption>

          </figure>
          <p>
            The emperors have amazing adaptations that help them withstand the
            cold, go without food for many long weeks, and make arduous trips
            back and forth to the sea. Their adaptations for diving are
            impressive as well. Their dives have been measured to 1800 feet (550
            m) and dives lasting more than 20 minutes have been recorded.
            Pressure increases with depth, which endangers gas-filled organs
            such as the lungs, but the emperors can protect their lungs by
            collapsing them. This stops the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to
            the bloodstream, but the emperors conserve oxygen by slowing their
            heart rate during dives. They also have extraordinary amounts of
            oxygen stored in muscle tissue and can use virtually all the oxygen
            in their bloodstream before having to surface for more.

            Paul Ponganis, who is both a research biologist and an
            anesthesiologist, studies diving penguins at Antarctica’s Penguin
            Ranch research facility with his colleague from the Scripps
            Institution of Oceanography, Jerry Kooyman. Ponganis thinks that
            what they learn about emperor physiology may have applications for
            human medical care such as for stroke victims who can sustain
            permanent damage if their brains don’t get enough oxygen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emperors have successfully survived for millennia, but as the
            environment undergoes rapid changes, their future is uncertain.
            Global warming may result in thin, unstable fast ice that breaks out
            too early, drowning eggs or chicks. Emperors also seem likely to
            face a declining food supply due both to pressure from commercial
            fisheries and to climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
            In December 2008, however, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service denied
            protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to the emperor
            penguin and two other penguins it had considered, although it did
            propose to list six penguin species. According to its news release
            on December 17, “The Service does not have sufficient scientific
            information to conclude that in the foreseeable future, the habitat
            of the emperor penguin will be altered to the point where the
            species is threatened with extinction.”
